# Progress Update - March 26, 2025

## What We've Accomplished

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment
- ✅ Created standalone Streamlit deployment file `streamlit_cloud_standalone.py` that doesn't depend on external imports
- ✅ Fixed directory creation issues by ensuring all required directories exist before any file operations
- ✅ Added proper error handling for logging and file operations to prevent application crashes
- ✅ Successfully pushed deployment code to GitHub on branch `streamlit_cloud_deploy`
- ✅ Created comprehensive cloud deployment documentation in `CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Debug Mode Enhancements
- ✅ Fixed RiskManager initialization to properly accept and use debug mode flag
- ✅ Added mock data generation for testing without real API credentials
- ✅ Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies (binance, telegram, etc.)
- ✅ Created a simplified test script to verify core components functionality
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in import statements with try-except blocks

### Code Structure Improvements
- ✅ Updated module imports to be more resilient to missing dependencies
- ✅ Reorganized logging configuration to ensure it works properly in cloud environments
- ✅ Fixed frequency parameter warning in pandas date_range by replacing 'H' with 'h'
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies and version specifications

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Priority)
1. Complete Streamlit Cloud deployment by logging in to Streamlit Cloud and deploying the `streamlit_cloud_standalone.py` file
2. Verify the deployed app functions correctly with mock data
3. Fix any issues identified during deployment testing
4. Fix the `NaN` import issue from numpy causing strategy module import failures

### Medium Term
1. Create unit tests for all core components
2. Implement MLflow for experiment tracking
3. Set up Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
4. Test strategies with historical data to validate performance

### Long Term
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
2. Set up automated testing and deployment
3. Implement monitoring and alerting system
4. Prepare for production deployment with real API credentials

## Notes
- The standalone version works well for demonstration purposes without requiring API credentials
- Do not use mock data in production - use real Binance UK API data
- All code changes have maintained compatibility with Python 3.9+
- Current structure supports future integration of advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning strategies
