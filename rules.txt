# Project Rules and Constraints

# General Rules
- Never use mock data or test net - always use real Binance UK API
- Only use Python 3.9+ for all code
- All components must run in a single Docker container
- No multi-container solutions or Docker Compose allowed

# Security
- Never hard-code credentials in source files
- Store Binance API keys as environment variables or in a secrets vault
- Use minimal permissions for API keys (trading only, no withdrawal permissions)

# Risk Management
- Implement mandatory stop-loss on all trades
- Implement take-profit mechanisms where appropriate
- Create a circuit breaker that halts trading if daily loss threshold is reached
- Ensure safe exploration in reinforcement learning (max position size capped, drawdown penalties)

# Data Management
- Store time-series data in Parquet files (1m, 5m, 1h, daily bars)
- Use proper feature engineering for technical indicators
- Use vectorized operations with Pandas/NumPy for efficiency

# Compliance
- Store trade logs for regulatory/audit requirements
- Follow Binance UK's rate limiting constraints
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

# Development
- Follow a consistent coding style
- Document all major functions and classes
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
