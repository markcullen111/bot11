README: Fully Autonomous Binance UK Trading Bot
1. Project Overview

This repository aims to build a fully autonomous cryptocurrency trading bot that operates on Binance UK. It combines rule-based strategies, machine learning (ML), and reinforcement learning (RL) to make trading decisions. The bot must run inside a single Docker container and provide a Streamlit web GUI for real-time monitoring, performance analytics, and strategy controls.

Key Features & Goals:

    Integration with Binance UK via the python-binance GitHub repo for REST and WebSocket data.

    Multi-strategy approach:

        Rule-Based (Trend Following, Mean Reversion).

        ML (using scikit-learn on GitHub).

        RL (using Stable Baselines3 on GitHub — PPO, SAC, TD3).

    Data Storage in Parquet files for time-series data (1m, 5m, 1h, daily).

    Backtesting & Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna on GitHub.

    Experiment Tracking with MLflow on GitHub (PnL, Sharpe, drawdowns, etc.).

    Risk Management (stop-loss, position sizing, circuit breaker).

    CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

        Automated testing, backtesting, Docker builds, and deployment.

    Streamlit GUI (on port 8501) for:

        Real-time metrics (PnL, open positions).

        Historical performance graphs.

        Strategy toggles and risk settings.

        Logs & alerts view (with optional Telegram integration).

2. Requirements & Constraints

    Python 3.9+ Only

        All code must be written in Python 3.9+ with no alternative languages or frameworks.

    Docker Containerization

        A single Dockerfile at the repo root builds an image with all dependencies.

        No other container solutions (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes) are permitted.

        Refer to the Docker docs and Docker’s GitHub org if needed.

    Rate Limiting

        Use a token bucket or fixed sleep intervals to comply with Binance’s strict request quotas.

    Credential Management

        Binance API keys must be stored as environment variables or secrets in a vault.

        Never hard-code credentials in source files.

    Binance UK Compliance & Logging

        Must store trade logs for regulatory/audit requirements.

        Follow minimal permissions for API keys (trading only, no withdrawal permissions).

    Risk Controls

        Mandatory stop-loss and take-profit.

        Circuit breaker that halts trading if daily loss threshold is reached.

        Reinforcement Learning must include safe exploration (max position size capped, drawdown penalties, etc.).

3. Data Collection & Storage

    Time-Series Data: Store 1m, 5m, 1h, and daily bars in Parquet files locally.

    Indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, MACD, plus any custom features.

    Vectorized Feature Engineering using Pandas & NumPy.

    (Optional) Order Book Snapshots: If capturing them, also store in Parquet.

4. Multi-Strategy Architecture

    Rule-Based Strategies:

        Trend Following

        Mean Reversion

    ML Strategies:

        scikit-learn for classification/regression.

    RL Strategies:

        Stable Baselines3 (PPO, SAC, TD3).

        Include a custom Gym-like environment for safe exploration and reward shaping.

Strategy Manager: A central orchestrator that enables or disables specific strategies, funnels data into them, and handles order execution decisions.
5. Backtesting & Hyperparameter Tuning

    Backtester Module:

        Loads Parquet data.

        Simulates trades for each strategy over multi-year periods.

        Logs PnL, drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino to MLflow.

    Optuna:

        Optuna automates hyperparameter tuning.

        Stores each tuning run in MLflow for reproducibility.

6. Online & Offline Learning

    Offline/Batch Retraining:

        Scheduled retraining (e.g., every 24 hours) with fresh data (Parquet files).

        Compare new model performance vs. currently deployed model in MLflow.

    Online/Incremental Learning (Optional):

        If feasible, update models in real-time with incremental data.

        Automatically deploy if new model outperforms existing model.

7. Live Trading Deployment

    Docker Container:

        Must support continuous operation (always-on).

        Use asyncio for real-time data streams and concurrency.

    CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

        On code push: run tests + short backtest.

        If successful, build Docker image and publish.

        Automatic deployment to production environment.

        Rollback if the new build underperforms.

    Risk Management:

        Enforce dynamic position sizing based on volatility.

        Force stop-loss on every order.

        Circuit breaker for daily loss threshold.

8. Monitoring & Logging

    Logging: Python logging for structured logs (timestamp, level, module, message).

    MLflow:

        MLflow on GitHub to track experiments, metrics (PnL, Sharpe, etc.), hyperparameters, code version.

    Prometheus + Grafana:

        Prometheus GitHub and Grafana GitHub.

        Real-time metrics dashboard: PnL, trades, system resource usage.

    Alerts:

        Telegram notifications for critical events (circuit breaker triggers, large drawdowns, API disconnections).

        Optionally integrate with email or Slack if needed.

9. Streamlit Web GUI

    Runs inside the same Docker container on port 8501.

    Features:

        Live PnL, open positions, net exposure.

        Historical performance charts (drawdown, Sharpe, etc.).

        Strategy Controls (enable/disable, set risk parameters).

        Logs & Alerts section.

        Authentication (simple password or token-based).

    Auto-Refresh to display the latest metrics (or manual refresh button).

    Powered by Streamlit on GitHub.
