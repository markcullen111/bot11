# Trading Bot Development Plan

## Project Structure
1. Set up the basic project structure:
   - Create Dockerfile at root
   - Create requirements.txt for Python dependencies
   - Set up the main app directory
   - Create README.md

2. Initial Repository Setup:
   - Initialize app directory structure
   - Set up Git repository

## Core Components
3. Binance Integration:
   - Create data collection module using python-binance
   - Implement rate limiting for API requests
   - Set up WebSocket connections for real-time data

4. Data Storage:
   - Implement Parquet file storage for time-series data
   - Create feature engineering pipeline with technical indicators
   - Set up data pre-processing utilities

5. Trading Strategies:
   - Implement rule-based strategies (trend following, mean reversion)
   - Develop ML strategies using scikit-learn
   - Create RL strategies using Stable Baselines3
   - Build strategy manager for coordinating multiple strategies

6. Backtesting System:
   - Develop backtesting framework
   - Integrate with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
   - Set up MLflow for experiment tracking

7. Risk Management:
   - Implement stop-loss mechanisms
   - Create position sizing algorithms
   - Add circuit breaker functionality
   - Build portfolio risk controls

8. Web Interface:
   - Create Streamlit dashboard
   - Implement real-time metrics display
   - Add strategy controls and settings
   - Create logs and alerts view

9. Deployment:
   - Finalize Docker configuration
   - Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Implement testing pipeline

### Currently In Progress
- [ ] Connect Streamlit UI with trading backend
- [ ] Test end-to-end trading flow with Streamlit UI

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Create unit tests for strategies
- [ ] Integrate with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Set up MLflow for experiment tracking
- [ ] Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Complete production deployment setup
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting system

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Finalize integration between Streamlit UI and trading backend
2. Implement unit tests for all strategy modules
3. Set up MLflow for experiment tracking
4. Integrate Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
6. Comprehensive end-to-end testing

## Notes
- Never use mock data or test net - use real Binance UK API
- All code must be in Python 3.9+ only
- Single Docker container for all components
- Implement proper risk management 
- RL strategy implemented using Stable Baselines3 with PPO, A2C, and DQN algorithms
- Custom TradingEnvironment created for reinforcement learning
- Strategy Manager coordinates multiple strategies with configurable weighting and aggregation methods
- Backtesting framework supports multiple strategies, performance metrics, and visualization
