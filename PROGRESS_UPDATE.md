# Progress Update - March 26, 2025

## What We've Accomplished

### Streamlit UI and Backend Integration
- ✅ Improved the API layer with proper async handling for Streamlit integration
- ✅ Added thread-safe run_async function to handle coroutines in Streamlit's synchronous environment
- ✅ Created a better SharedState design pattern with direct property access
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in API module with proper fallbacks for debug mode
- ✅ Fixed data update mechanism to work properly with asyncio
- ✅ Improved mock data generation for testing and demo purposes

### Streamlit App Enhancements
- ✅ Added trading pair management in the sidebar
- ✅ Improved dashboard with technical indicator visualizations
- ✅ Enhanced the strategy control page with better configuration options
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for API imports
- ✅ Added better portfolio visualization in the dashboard
- ✅ Improved position and trade display with styling

### Debug Mode Enhancements
- ✅ Fixed RiskManager initialization to properly accept and use debug mode flag
- ✅ Added mock data generation for testing without real API credentials
- ✅ Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies (binance, telegram, etc.)
- ✅ Created a simplified test script to verify core components functionality
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in import statements with try-except blocks

### Code Structure Improvements
- ✅ Updated module imports to be more resilient to missing dependencies
- ✅ Reorganized logging configuration to ensure it works properly in cloud environments
- ✅ Fixed frequency parameter warning in pandas date_range by replacing 'H' with 'h'
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies and version specifications

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Priority)
1. Test the integration between Streamlit UI and trading backend with real data
2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud using `streamlit_cloud_standalone.py`
3. Fix any remaining issues with the integration
4. Add unit tests for core components

### Medium Term
1. Complete unit tests for all strategy modules
2. Set up MLflow for experiment tracking
3. Implement Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
4. Enhance backtesting functionality with more metrics

### Long Term
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
2. Set up automated testing and deployment
3. Implement monitoring and alerting system
4. Prepare for production deployment with real API credentials

## Technical Notes
- The async/sync bridge in the API module allows Streamlit to work with the async trading backend
- Mock data generation properly handles time-series data with realistic patterns
- The SharedState pattern provides a clean interface between UI and backend
- Strategy management now properly handles parameter updates with validation
- All improvements maintain compatibility with both local development and cloud deployment
